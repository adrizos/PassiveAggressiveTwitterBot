## ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
This bot listens for posts from a particular account. Every time this account posts,
PassAggressiveTwitterBot will copy the tweet text, add a random hashtag from a list,
and then upload a random image from the /images directory.

A few instances of this bot have been deployed on a Heroku server and still live today!
